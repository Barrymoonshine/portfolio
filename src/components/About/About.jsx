      <h2>Welcome to my Portfolio</h2>
      <h4>Hey there, I'm nick a self-taught full stack Software Developer!</h4>
      <p>
        I love learning about new technologies and the flow state when you
        immerse yourself in a coding problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm passionate about the potential technology has to solve some of the problems that society and the environment face today. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not developing software, I like cooking (my speciality is
        seafood!), playing the piano and tennis.
